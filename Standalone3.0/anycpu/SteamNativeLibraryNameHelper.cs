	/// <summary>
	/// Advanced helper class to resolve the correct platform-specific binary filename for Steamworks native libraries
	/// from Steamworks.NET.AnyCPU internally defined library names on <see cref="DllImportAttribute"/>.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This class provided a sample in XMLDoc to help you <b>correctly</b> implement your own <see cref="DllImportResolver"/>
	/// for Steamworks native libraries against Steamworks.NET.AnyCPU's P/Invoke usages.<br/>
	/// Navigate to <see cref="SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper"/> in your IDE to read the sample code in XMLDoc, or check the source code of this class for more details.
	/// <para/>
	/// As a consumer you must set your resolver before any access to <see cref="Steamworks"/> other than class <see cref="SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper"/>,
	/// or <see cref="NativeLibrary"/> will lock the resolver table preventing your resolver from applying.<para/>
	/// For best practices, your resolver should be set as early as you can. Main() method is a good place to set your resolver, or early initialization code of your Steamworks manager class.<br/>	
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// English explaination:
	/// <code>
	/// // Example resolver
	/// // In your own <see cref="DllImportResolver"/> method like this, you can use this helper to resolve the correct platform-specific binary filename for Steamworks native libraries.
	/// // such resolvers can be a static method or even a lambda, as you retrieve enough information to locate the binaries.
	/// IntPtr YourSteamworksDllImportResolver(string libraryName, System.Reflection.Assembly assembly, System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportSearchPath? searchPath)
	/// {
	///		// In your resolver, you can use this helper class to resolve the correct platform-specific binary filename for Steamworks native libraries.
	///		// To prevent misuses like resolve arbitrary native library, the helper will throw <see cref="ArgumentException"/>
	///		// if the library name is not from Steamworks.NET.AnyCPU.
	///		
	///		// DO NOT prepend or append any directory or extension to the library name,
	///		// just pass the P/Invoke library name as is from the <see cref="DllImportResolver"/> parameters.
	///		string platformSpecificBinaryFileName = SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper.ResolvePlatformBinaryFileName(libraryName);
	///		
	///		string fullPathToYourLibrary = Path.Combine(GetYourNativeLibraryFolder(), platformSpecificBinaryFileName);
	///		
	///		if (!NativeLibrary.TryLoad(fullPathToYourLibrary, assembly, searchPath, out lib))
	///		{
	///			// throw desired exception or handle the error as you see fit
	///			// .NET Runtime provided resolution logic can't work in general, so you need to provide your own fallback resolution logic here.
	///		}
	///		
	///		return lib;
	///	}
	///	
	/// // Once you gather enough information to locate the binaries, you can set your resolver like this:
	/// NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver(typeof(SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper).Assembly, YourDllImportResolver);
	/// </code>
	/// <para/>
	/// For NativeAOT compiled Godot 4.7+ games with "Embed Build Outputs" unchecked,
	/// you can use the following resolver code to load Steamworks native libraries from the data directory:
	/// <code>
	/// // add this snippet into your Steamwork manager node's _Ready()
	/// if (!RuntimeFeature.IsDynamicCodeSupported)
	/// {
	///		NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver(typeof(SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper).Assembly, static (lib, asm, sp) => {
	///			const string dataDirectory = "data_Darmok_windows_x86_64"; // replace it with your own data directory
	///			NativeLibrary.TryLoad(Path.Combine(dataDirectory, SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper.ResolvePlatformBinaryFileName(lib)), asm, sp, out IntPtr handle);
	///			return handle;
	///		});

	/// // you are able to call SteamAPI.InitEx() now
	/// </code>

	/// 中文解释：
	/// <code>
	/// // 示例Resolver的伪代码，需要在访问Steamworks.NET.AnyCPU任何类之前设置（本类除外），否则<see cref="NativeLibrary"/>会锁定Resolver表，
	/// // 然后在挂你的Resolver上去的时候抛出<see cref="InvalidOperationException"/>。
	/// // 必须调用<see cref="SteamNativeLibraryNameHelper"/>里面的辅助方法获取库的文件名。
